# Program Description
This program allows you to convert the contents of a file into different number bases. Supported formats include binary, octal, and hexadecimal. In addition to files, you can also enter a string directly from the keyboard and view its representation in one of these formats.
The program is designed primarily for exploration, letting you see how text or file data looks when expressed in different bases. For performance reasons, it is recommended that you avoid using very large files.

***Comment: This program is implemented using PowerShell.***
